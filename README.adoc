This project aims to provide a java based command line client which can be used
to perform stress tests on an EUDAT B2ACCESS instance.

== Installation

=== CENTOS 

Currently the instructions provided are targeting a Centos 7 installation.

==== Base requirements

Other required tools: maven, git, ..., can be installed with the following command:
[source,sh]

== Known Issues

=== Headless chrome not working

Symptom: When running chrome in headless mode the tests fail with an empty html skeleton
send by the server. 

Explanation: This is caused by missing functionality to handle the client certificate
request send by B2ACCESS.

Example output from the chromedriver.log:
[source,sh]
----
[4.035][DEBUG]: DEVTOOLS COMMAND Page.navigate (id=12) {
   "url": "https://unity.eudat-aai.fz-juelich.de:8443/home/home"
}
...
[4.934][DEBUG]: DEVTOOLS EVENT Log.entryAdded {
   "entry": {
      "level": "error",
      "networkRequestId": "93574.1",
      "source": "network",
      "text": "Failed to load resource: net::ERR_SSL_CLIENT_AUTH_CERT_NEEDED",
      "timestamp": 1505207036850.29,
      "url": "https://unity.eudat-aai.fz-juelich.de:8443/home/home"
   }
}
----

Solution: None, don't run in headless mode until this issue is fixed in chrome / chromium.
